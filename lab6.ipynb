    "# Lab 6: Momentum Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will focus on **momentum transfer** in fluid mechanics, which describes the movement of mass and velocity in a flowing fluid. Understanding momentum transfer is crucial for analyzing forces and designing efficient systems involving fluid flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Definition of Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "The **momentum** of a fluid element is defined as the product of its mass and velocity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P = m v$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $P$ is the momentum (kgÂ·m/s),\n",
    "- $m$ is the mass of the fluid element (kg),\n",
    "- $v$ is the velocity of the fluid (m/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a continuous flow, momentum transfer is related to the **force** exerted by the fluid on surrounding boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Conservation of Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of **conservation of momentum** states that the total momentum of a system is constant unless acted upon by an external force. In the context of a fluid flowing through a pipe, this principle is applied to understand how momentum is transferred through the fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general equation for conservation of momentum in a control volume is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum F_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\sum m_i v_i \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $F_{\\text{ext}}$ is the external force applied to the system (N),\n",
    "- $m_i$ is the mass of the fluid in the $i$-th element (kg),\n",
    "- $v_i$ is the velocity of the fluid in the $i$-th element (m/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "In steady-state flow, the rate of change of momentum is zero, so external forces are balanced by the internal forces in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Momentum Flux\n",
    "\n",
    "The **momentum flux** across a section of a pipe is given by the product of the mass flow rate and the velocity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{m} v$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate (kg/s),\n",
    "- $v$ is the velocity of the fluid (m/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass flow rate is related to the volumetric flow rate $Q$ and the fluid density $\\rho$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{m} = \\rho Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the momentum flux is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho Q v$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.4 Momentum Transfer in a Pipe\n",
    "\n",
    "In a pipe, the force exerted by the fluid on the pipe wall can be calculated from the change in momentum of the fluid. The momentum equation for flow in a pipe is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum F_{\\text{wall}} = \\dot{m} (v_{\\text{out}} - v_{\\text{in}})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $F_{\\text{wall}}$ is the force exerted by the fluid on the pipe wall (N),\n",
    "- $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate (kg/s),\n",
    "- $v_{\\text{out}}$ is the velocity of the fluid at the pipe exit (m/s),\n",
    "- $v_{\\text{in}}$ is the velocity of the fluid at the pipe inlet (m/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation represents the difference in momentum between the inlet and outlet, and can be used to determine the forces acting on pipe bends, nozzles, and other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.5 Example: Momentum Change in a Pipe\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a pipe with a velocity of 5 m/s at the inlet and 3 m/s at the outlet, with a mass flow rate of 1.2 kg/s. The force exerted by the fluid on the pipe wall is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum F_{\\text{wall}} = 1.2 \\cdot (3 - 5) = -2.4 \\text{ N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This negative value indicates that the fluid is exerting a force in the opposite direction of the flow, which is typical for bends or changes in flow direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.6 Applications of Momentum Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum transfer is critical in the analysis of:\n",
    "- **Pumps**: Understanding the forces acting on pumps and designing efficient impellers.\n",
    "- **Turbines**: Analyzing the forces exerted on turbines and optimizing energy extraction.\n",
    "- **Nozzles**: Calculating the forces acting on a nozzle due to changes in velocity and pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding momentum transfer, we can design systems that effectively manage and utilize the forces involved in fluid flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution has been prepared [here](lab6_expts_solution.html) for Python users.\n"
